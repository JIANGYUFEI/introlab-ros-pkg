ROS Interface to IntRoLab's ManyEars audio sound source localization, tracking and separtion algorithm.

More information on ManyEars can be found here:

= USAGE =

== CONFIGURATION ==

0) Make sure your sound card & microphone are working!

1) You must configure your microphone array before starting the system. Use the ManyEars GUI to position your 
   individual microphones and tune the system. 

   $> rosrun manyears ManyEars

   Once done, save the configuration file for usage with the launch files using the 
   "Parameters->Save the parameters of the system" menu.

2) Modify the launch files to fit your configuration. Edit the file "manyears_ros/launch/manyears_live.launch"
   and change the line "<param name="config_file" value="$(find manyears_ros)/data/small_cube.mes" />" with your 
   saved configuration at step 1).

3) Modify the pose of the array according to /base_link. If you want the source to be positioned properly, 
   change the position of the micro_center_link in "manyears_ros/launch/manyears_pose.launch".

== STARTING THE SYSTEM ==

$> roslaunch manyears_ros manyears_complete_live.launch

Separated sources will be stored in the /tmp directory in the WAV format.

== ROS TOPICS AVAILABLE ==
$> rostopic list

/manyears/source_pose    --->Sources positions (using TF)
/manyears/sources_info   --->Sources informations (ids, positions, separated information 48000Hz, normalized floats[-1,1])
/manyears/stream         --->Audio stream from the sound card, 48000Hz, 16 bits, LE. 
/rosout
/rosout_agg
/tf

== VISUALISATION OF SOURCES POSES WITH RVIZ ==
You can configure RViz to visualize the source pose. Have a look at this screenshot for a sample.

== NEED A SOUND CARD ? ==
We have made our sound card "Open Source". Please visit :
